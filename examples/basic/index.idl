This document uses [Link href:"https://github.com/idyll-lang/idyll-loader-component" text:"idyll-loader-component"/] to build a component that displays plots using an external library without blocking the entire page.

[Loader scrollwatch:`true` scrollrange:0]

This could easily be used to lazy-load images. The more interesting case though is using `Loader` to add dynamic content without blocking page load. In particular, the first you can either load an external script once when the page loads or lazily once the first component that needs it loads. Since it manages load events, this all makes it a bit easier to avoid worrying about ensuring the library is loaded before you use it. [Figref number:1/] shows a plot of [Equation]y = x + 1[/Equation]. It's accomplished by creating [link href:"https://github.com/rreusser/idyll-loader-component/blob/master/examples/basic/components/lineplot.js" text:"a custom component"/] with the following code:

```
class Lineplot extends PlotlyComponent {
  plot (gd) {
    Plotly.plot(gd, {
      data: [{
        y: [1, 2, 3]
      }], layout: {
        margin: {t: 40, r: 30, b: 30, l: 30}
      }
    });
  }
}
```

The [Link href:"https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js" text:"plotly.js"/] component just uses the loader, which is also very simple to use:

```
render () {
  return <Loader src="..." onLoad={this.onLoad}>
    I'm content added after the script loads!
  </Loader>
}
```

    [Caption]Second figure, same as the first. Except this one has a long caption that wraps nicely onto the next line because I mean captions trivial and all, but it actually takes like twenty minutes to sit down and sort out the block/inline CSS centering stuff, plus including an equation wraps the whole thing in a `p` tag so that it's actually really really nice if it all Just Worksâ„¢.[/Caption]

And for some reason [Figref number:2/] shows the same plot again, but hey at least it only loads the plotly cdn script once and the end-user doesn't have to worry about including the script at all.

And of course it wouldn't be complete without good old json loading. In this case I downloaded the data from [Link href:"plot.ly/~rreusser/99.json" text:"plot.ly/~rreusser/99.json"/] and dropped it in my `data/` folder.
